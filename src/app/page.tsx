              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                Blogging lets you share your passion while earning. Side hustle blogs add extra income; startups can replace your job. Both can grow huge with the right strategy.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                It works because people search Google for answers, landing on your blog. Earnings start small but scale – think $100/month to $20,000 with time. Established blogs hit big bucks.

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                No-investment leans on effort – writing and promoting for free. Invested uses cash for speed, like paid tools or marketing. We'll explore both, with blogging as the perfect low-entry business.
